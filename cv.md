## About me
***
For more than 5 years I was fixing and
assembling computers and telephones,
so Iâ€™m aware of  everything connected with
the hardware and modern trends in the
techno world. During the whole 2020 I was
studying HTML / CSS, JS, React and even much more.
Now I am looking for a team and a project  e
where I can apply acquired knowledge,
realize my ideas and write high-quality code.
I have an analytical thinking , adapt rather quickly
to changes, make a connection easily and get
on well with people, overcome stressful
situations with  confidence  , find simple
solutions for the difficult situations and
have a huge amount of motivation and a desire to learn.
